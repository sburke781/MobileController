# Current Status
This project is in it's infancy, with development commenced in Sept 2022 and an early release made in December 2023.  More work will be done in the coming months.

# Supported Technologies
Early versions of this project have focused on using Tasker on an Android mobile device to send and receive information and issue commands from a Hubitat hub.  Future work may start to introduce MacroDroid for mobile control and expand into use of Node RED and Home Assistant as home automation platforms that can be communicated with.  There are no immediate plans for support of Apple devices.
